# Lecture 5 

# Caching example
- Scenario:
  - access link rate: 1.54 Mbps
  - RTT from institutional router to server: 2 sec
  - Web object size: 100k bits
  - Average request rate from browsers to origin servers: 15/sec
    - average data rate to browsers: 1.5 MBps
- Performance:
  - Lan utilization: .0015
  - access link utilization = .97 
  - end-end delay = internet delay + access link delay + LAN delay
  - = 2 sec + minutes + usecs 

# install a web cache
- Calculating access link utilization, end-end delay with cache
  - suppose cache hit rate is .4 40% requests satisfied at chaceh 60% aat origin
  - access link 60% of of requests use access


# conditional GET
- Goal don't send object if cache has up to data cached version
  - no object transmission delay
  - lower link utilizatin
- cache: specify date of cached copy in HTTP request
  - if-modified-since date
- server: response contains no object if cached copy is up to date 
- HTTP/1.0 304 not modified
- \

# HTTP/2 
- Key goal decreased delay in multi-object HTTP requests
- HTTP1.1 introduced multiple, pipelined GETs over single TCP conneciton
  - server responds in order FCFS: scheduling to GET requests
  - with FCFS small object may have to wait for transmission (Head of line blocking ) behind large objects
  - loss recovery (retransmitting lost TCP segments) stalls object transmission 
- HTTP/2 increased flexibility at server in sending objects to client:
  - methods, status codes, most header fields unchanged from HTTP 1.1
  - transmission order of requestsed objects based on client specified object priority
  - push unrequeted objects to client
  - divide objects into frames, schedule frames to mitigate HOL blocking 
- HTTP/2: mitigating HOL blocking 
  - cut objects into pieces and transmit one at a time 
- HTTP/3 
  - key goal decreased delay in multi object HTTP requests
  - HTTP/2 over single TCP connection means:
    - recovery from packet loss still stalls all object transmissions
    - as in HTTP1.1, browers have incentive to open multiple parallel connections to reduce stalling, increase overall throughput
    - no security over vanilla TCP 
  - HTTP3 adds security, per object error and congestion control (more pipelining) over UDP 
    - more on HTTP/3 in transport layer
# DNS 
- Domain name service
- people: many identifiers:
  - SSN, name, passport # 
- internet hosts, routers
  - IP address (32 bit) used for addressing datagrams
  - name e.g. cs.umass.edu used by humans
- map between IP address and name 
-  distributed database implemented in hierarchy of many name servers
-  application layr protocol: hosts name servers communicate to resolve names
   -  core internet function implemented as application layer protocol
   -  complexity at networks edge
-  hostname to IP address translation 
   -  host aliasing
      -  canonical, alias names
   -  mail server aliasing 
   -  load distribution 
   -  replicated web servers, many ip addresses correspond to one name
-  Q. Why not centralize DNS?
   -  single point fo failure
   -  traffic volume 
   -  distant centralized database 
   -  maintenance
-  A. doesn't Scale
   -  comcast DNS servers alone 600B DNS queries per day
# DNS example
- client wants ip address for www.amazon.com; 1st approximation
  - client queries root server to find .com DNS server
  - client queries .com DNS server to get amazon.com DNS server
  - client queries amazon.com DNS server to get IP address of www.amazon.com 
- goes Root dns server -> Top level domain server -> authoritative Server 

# DNS root name servers
- official, contact of last resort by name servers that can not resolve name
- incredibly important internet functino 
  - internet could not function without it
  - DNSSEC provides security (authentication and message integrity )
# TLD: authoritative servers
- Top level domain servers
  - responsible for ,com, org, net, edu, aero, jobs, .museums, and all top level country domains
  - network solutionsL authoritative registry for .com, .net TLD
- Authoritative DNS servers
  - organization's own DNS server providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization's named hosts 
  - can be maintained by organization or service providers

# local DNS servers
- does not strictly belong to hierarchy
- each ISP (residential ISP, company, university ) has one 
  - also called "default name server"
- when host makes DNS query, query is sent to its local DNS server
  - has local cache of recent name-to-address translation pairs (but may be out of date )
  - acts as proxy, forwards query into hierarchy

# DNS name resolution iterated query
- iterated query:
  - contacted server replies with naem of server to contact
  - "I don't know this name, but ask this server"

# Caching, updating DNS records
- once any name server learns mapping, it caches mapping
  - cache entries timeout after some time 
  - TLD servers typically cached in local name servers
    - thus root name servers not often visited
- cached entries may be out of date (best-effort name-to-address translation)
  - if name host changes ip addresss, may not be known internet wide until all TTLs expire
- update/notify mechanisms proposed IETF standard RFS 2136 

# DNS Records
- DNS distributed database storing resource records (RR)
- RR format (name, value, type, ttl)
- type=A
  - name is hostname
  - value is IP address
- type NS 
  - name is domain
  - value is hostname of authoritative name server for this domain
- type=CNAME 
  - name is alias name for some "canonical" name
  - ibm.com is really servereast.backup2.ibm.com
  - value is canonical name
- type=MX
  - value is name of mailserver associated with name 

# DNS protocol messages
- DNS query and reply messages, both have same format:
  - message header 
    - identification: 16 bit # for query, reply to query uses same #
  - flags:
    - query or reply
    - recursion desired
    - recursion available
    - reply is authoritative 
  - number of questions
  - number of answers
  - number authority RRs 
  - number additioanl RRs
  - questions ()
  - answers
  - ...

# Inserting records into DNS
- exsample new startup "Network Utopia"
  - register name networkutopia.com at DNS registrar 
    - provide names, IP addresses of authoritative name server (primary and secondary)
    - registrar inserts NS, A RRs into .com TLD server:
    - (networkutopia.com, dns1.networkutopia.com, NS)
    - (dns1.networkutopia.com, 212.212.212.1, A)
  - create authoritatitive server locally with IP address 212.212.212.1
    - type A record for www.networkutopia.com
    - type MX record for networkutopia.com

# P2P applications
- no always-on server
- arbitrary end systems directly communicate
- peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
  - self scalability - new peers bring new service capacity , and new service demands
- Peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
  - complex management
- examples: P2P file sharing(BitTorrent), streaming (KanKan), VoIP (Skype)
