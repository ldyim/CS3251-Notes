## TCP sequence numbers, ACKs
- sequence numbers:
  - byte stream number of first byte in segment's data
- Acknowledgements:
  - seq# of next byte expected from other side 
  - cumulative ACK
- Q. How does receiver handle out of order segments
  - A. TCP spec doesn't say, up to implementor 




## TCP round trip time, timeout
- Q: how to set TCP timeout value?
  - longer than RTT, but RTT varies
  - too short: premature timeot, unnecessary retransmissions
  - too long: slow reaction to segment loss
- Q: how to estimate RTT?
  - SampleRTT: measured time from segment transission until ACK receipt
    - ignore retransmission 
  - SampleRTT will vary, want estimated RTT "smoother"
    - average several recent measurements, not just current SampleRTT
- EstimatedRTT = (1-alpha)*EstimatedRTT + alpha * sampleRTT
- exponential weighted moving average (EWMA)
- influence of past sampel decreases exponentially fast
- typical value: alpha = .125
- timeout interval: estimatedRTT + safety margin
  - large variation in EstimatedRTT want a larger margin
    - timeout interval = EstimatedRTT + 4* DevRTT
  - DevRTT = EWMA of SampleRTT deviation from EstimatedRTT
    - DevRTT = (1-Beta)* DevRTT + Beta * |SampleRTT-EstimatedRTT|



## TCP Sender
- event: data received from application
  - create segment with seq# 
  - seq# is byte-stream number of first data byte in segment
  - start timer if not already running
    - think of timer as for oldest unACKed segment
    - expiration interval: TimeOutInterval
- event: timeout
  - retransmit segment that caused timeout
  - restart timer
- event: ACK received
  - if ACK acknowledges previously unACKed segments
    - update what is known to be ACKed
    - start timer if there are still unACKed segments


## TCP receiver: ACK generation
- event:
- arrival of in-order segments with expected seq#. All data up to expeccted seq# already ACKed
  - delayed ACK. Wait up to 500ms for next segment. If no next segment, send ACK
- arrival of in order segment with expecetd seq#. One other segment has ACK pending
  - immediately send single cumulative ACK, ACKing both in- order segment
- arrival of out-or order segment higher than expect seq#. Gap detected
  - immediately send duplicate ACK indicating Seq# of next expected byte
- arrival of segment that partially or completely fills gap
  - immediate send ACK, provided that segment starts at lower end of gap 


## TCP flow control 
- application removing data from TCP socket buffers
  - takes in information from the buffer and frees up space in the buffer 
- TCP code puts information into the buffer
- what happens if network layer delivers data faster than application layer removes data from socket buffers?
  - overflow
- flow control part of segment 
  - indicated # of bytes receiver is willing to accept 
  - receiver controls sender so it won;t overflow the buffer
