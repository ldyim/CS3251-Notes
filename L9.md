## RDT 3.0 stop and wait
- too slow 


## rdt3.0 pipelined protocols operation
- pipelining: 
  - sender allows multiple "in-flight", yet to be acked packets
    - range of sequence numbers must be increased 
    - buffering at sender and/or receivers 
- increases utilization 
- U sender = 3(L/R)/(RTT + (L/R)) $ \frac{1}{2} $

## go-back-N
- never used in practice
- sender: "window" of up to N, consecutive but unacked pkts
  - k-bit seq # in pkt header
- need to wait for the first packet sent to be ACKed in order to move the window forward 
- cumulative ACK: ACK(n): ACKs all packets up to, including seq # n
  - on receiving ACK(n): move window forward to begin at n + 1
- timer for oldest in flight packet
- timeout(n): retransmit packet n and all higher seq# packets in window 


## go back N receiver
- ACK-only: always send ACK for correctly -received packet so far, with highest in-order seq#
  - may generate duplicate ACKs
  - need only remember rcv_base
    - rcv_base starting point of window receiver expects to receive
- on receipt of out of order packet:
  - can discard or buffer: implementation decision
  - if buffered, re-ACK pkt with highest in order seq #

## Selective repeat 
- more efficient and used more widely
- receiver individually acknowledges all correctly received packets
  - buffers packets as needed for eventual in-order delivery to upper layer
- sender times-out/retransmits individually for unACKed packets
  - sender maintains timer for each unACKed pkt
- sender window 
  - N consecutive seq #s
  - limits seq #s of sent, unACKed packets


## Selective repeat: sender and receiver 
- data from above:
  - if next available seq # in window, send packet
- timeout(n)
  - resend packet n 
- if using selective repeat even if you have 4 sequence numbers, you cannot support a window size of 3 
- receiver can only see on their side 
- if all ACK's are lost then the receiver will accept packets they are not meant to 
- what relationship between sequence # size and window size to avoid problems?
  - divide sequence # by 2
- TCP uses a tweaked version of selective repeat


## TCP: overview
- point to point
  - one sender, one receiver
- reliable, in-order byte stream:
  - no "message boundaries"
- full duplex data:
  - bi-directional data flow in same connection
  - MSS: maximum segment size 
- cumulative ACKs
- pipelining: 
  - TCP congestion and flow control set window size
- Connection-oriented:
  - handshaking initializes sender, receiver state before data exchange
- flow controlled:
  - sender will not overwhelm receiver 
# TCP segment structure
- first 2 bytes Source port # 
- next 2 dest port #
- next segment seq#: counting bytes of data into bytestream 4 bytes
- ACK: seq # of next exoected byte, 
- next bits are
  - 4 bits of header length 
  - 4 bits unused
  - C, E bits congestion notification
  -  A bit: this is an ACK - the data that the sender has received from the receiver in the past 
  - R,S,F: connection management
- 2 byte receive window for flow control: # of bnytes receiver willing to accept 
- 2 byte checksum 
- TCP options: max of 40 bytes
