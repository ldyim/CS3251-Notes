# File distribution: client-server vs P2P
- How much time to distribute file (size F) from one server to N peers
  - peer upload/download capacity is limited resource


# File distribution time: client-server
- server transmission: must sequentially send (upload) N file copies:
  - time to send one copy: F/u<sub>s</sub>
  - time to send N copies: NF/u<sub>s</sub>
- client: each client must download file copy
  - d_min = min client download rate
  - min client download time: F/d<sub>min</sub>
- time to distribute F to N clients using client server approach = D<sub>cs-s</sub> >= max(NF/U<sub>s</sub>, F/d<sub>min</sub>)



# File distribution time: P2P
- server transmission must upload at least one copy 
  - time to send one copy: F/u<sub>s</sub>
- client: each client must download file copy 
  - min client download time: F/d<sub>min</sub>
- clients: as aggregate must download NF bits
  - max upload rate (limiting max download rate) is u<sub>s</sub> + sigma u<sub>i
- D<sub>P2P</sub> > max(F/u<sub>s</sub>, F/d<sub>min</sub>, NF/(u<sub>s</sub> + sigmau<sub>i</sub>))

- P2P is much more scalable


# P2P file distribution: BitTorrent
- file divided into 256Kb chinks
- peers in torrent send/receive file chunks
  - tracker tracks peers participating in torrent
    - only tracks who is in the system not who has what chunk
  - torrent: group of peers exchanging chunks of a file 
  - if someone arrives, obtains list of peers from tracker and begins exchangiong chunks with the torrent

- peer joining torrent: has no chunks, but will accumulate them over time from other peers
- registers with tracker to get list of peers, connects to subset of peers ("neighbors") not all peers
- while downloading, peer uploads chunks to other peers
- peer may change e=peers with whom it exchanges chunks
- churn: peers may come and go
- once peer has entire file, it may (selfishly) leave or (altruistically) remain in torrent
